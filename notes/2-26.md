# 2/26 Meeting

## TODO for next meeting
- 1 person: write examples programs; Other person make rules (e.g. weird indentation) and test
- Scanner tester (like wordcount)
- By next meeting: working scanner, clarify rules

## Scanner
```
int def fib_recur(int n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib_recur(n-1) + fib_recur(n-2)
```

Convert to:
```
int def fib_recur(int n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    return fib_recur(n-1) + fib_recur(n-2);
}
```

Option 1:
Python: when you see newline, just check indentation level

Option 2:
Colon -> new block (make sure this is the only time colon is used)


Next level indentation is start of block.
Keep track of state in scanner. List of indentation level
Figure out what indentation level at beginning of each line

After line 9 when no colon insert ; then check indentation of next. iF backslash dont check indentation
